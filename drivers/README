This folder is for ther rev4 and rev16 drivers/modules. Source code is in the .c files. Pre-compiled modules
are the .ko files. To use a pre-compiled module, the linux distribution and kernel version must match those
on your system.

There are only a few pre-compiled modules here. If you want to help, you can upload your module after you
have recovered your data. Thanks in advance.
